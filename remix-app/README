- reload even after failed action (why?) -> use shouldRevalidate
- on reload load everything in loader
- strange page loading system: prepare page, then load it with data loaded,
so you have to wait on prev page for target page data loading
- to get data for combobox or something like this use api routes + fetcher.load or fetcher.submit
